Hue
===

Python bindings for the Philips Hue api. These are written against the
official hue api documentation, and will generally follow its
lead. Variable names will follow the json naming rather than introduce
differences to satisfy python style requirements.

See example.py for basic usage, and the tests and code for further details.

Alpha quality, expect the interface to change.
